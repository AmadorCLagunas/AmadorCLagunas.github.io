[Curriculum Vitae (CV)](https://amadorclagunas.github.io/files/Lagunas_CV_2024_10_14.pdf)

I'm a 5th year PhD student in the pNEURO Lab under the guidance of Dr. Tim Bruns. In my research I examine the effects of current neuromodulation therapies in humans and test novel electrode designs in preclincal experiments. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions!
